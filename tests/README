Unit tests for the GoProCamera module.

Originally written to not require further modules; at some point I wanted 
a feature from pytest, so added that and didn't go back and leverage pytest's
other features such as automatic fixtures and parametrized tests. So this is
still effectively stdlib unittest plus a little bit of pytest, which may
account for any weirdness you see.

Coverage is currently 100% excluding dead code, but some of the
testing just invokes functions without verifying behaviour.
